# Tree

### Binary Search Tree (Ordered Binary Tree || Sorted Binary Tree)
* If any node's left subtree is not `null`, the value of all nodes of that left subtree must be less than root node's value.
* If any node's right subtree is not `null`, the value of all nodes of that right subtree must be greater than root node's value.
* Any node's left or right subtree must be a binary search tree as well.
* No duplicate nodes (no nodes' values are the same).

### Red Black Tree
* Each node is either red or black.
* Tehe root is black.
* All leaves (NIL) are black.
* If a node is read, then both its children are black.
* Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains the same number of black nodes.
